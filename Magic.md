## Magic
The world is soaked in magic. Ancient gods walk the land in hope of finding new followers, demons lurk in the shadow hoping to drag your soul down to hell. Magic is the main tool to keep the darkness back along with sword and torch.

Magic brings great power but with that comes risk. A miscast spell can bring ruin upon a person or even a village. Additionally it can bring the attention of those who you'd rather avoid. Because of this public casting is frowned upon and can bring the attention of the local thugs or even witch-hunters.
