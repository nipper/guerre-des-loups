## Artifacts and other Miscellany
**Blessed Reliquary**
_The gold and wood box held the hand bones of Saint Danitus. It is said that her grace would protect all those who venture into darkness_
If you have to make a darkness check while in possession of this reliquary then you gain advantage to your check. The reliquary can help with five checks before it crumbles to dust. On each check one of the saints finger bones turns black as it absorbs the evil. 


**Masterwork Sword**
_A plain sword it looks to be nothing special until you pick it up. Only then are you aware of the skill of the smith who made this._
This sword gives you a bonus success-level on any successful attack.
